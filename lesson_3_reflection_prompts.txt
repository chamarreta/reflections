When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  
  When working on a collaborative project. Also, when working in the same project from
  different computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	
	Because maybe you are working in a branch that never will be shared.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Fork is only used in Github. It is usefull when you don't have permission on
	the respository you want to change. Clones works in both, local and Github.
	It is usefull when you want to download a respository from Github to local or
	when you want to have the same repository in two places of your computer.
	We have previously talk about branches. Are useful when you want to make some
	experimental changes or want to have a different version of the same project
	without affecting the master one.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	The benefit is that you can merge and resolve the conflicts locally and then
	upload the final version free of conflicts, so the collaborators can be sure
	that you have resolve all the conflicts.
