When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  
  When working on a collaborative project. Also, when working in the same project from
  different computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	
	Because maybe you are working in a branch that never will be shared.
