How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Because maybe the bug was introduced unwittingly and you will be able to
    find it if you compare two files.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Because you will be able to compare files and find bugs quicklier.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Manually you can choose logic times to commit, based in the changes you have
    done to the file. If the versions are automatically saved you can save time
    but the points selected won't be logical selected and will be bad to compare
    and look for bugs.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because one logical change in the source code can involve different files.
    This is not habitual in Docs writing.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Using the the command git log you can see the id of the different commits
    and the title of them. Once you have selected what commints you want to
    compare you can use the command git diff and you will be able to see the
    differences between the two commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    If you make a mistake you will be able to find it easyly using git. You
    will be able to compare, find and fix the mistake you made, so you can
    work safe and confident because your work is always secured.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I would like to use it for my Android Projects
